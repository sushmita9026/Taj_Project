                The goals of building the Taj Mahal were both personal and

                symmetry, lush gardens, and intricate decorations. By blending
                Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles, Shah Jahan sought to
                showcase the cultural harmony and sophistication of his empire.
                Ultimately, the Taj Mahal was meant to be a timeless
                masterpiece, inspiring awe and admiration for generations to
                come.
